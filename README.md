# üöÄ Getting started with Page Builder for Strapi

This template includes everything needed to start using Page Builder for Strapi.

To get set up with a ready-to use demo, run `npm run prepare` from the command line.

Page Builder requires an override to the default `strapi::security` middleware to allow it to load your site within an iframe. The prepare script above has update the defaults to include "http://localhost:3000" in the frame-src directive. This will need to be updated with your live site URL when ready for production.

```bash filename="config/middlewares.ts"
export default [
  'strapi::logger',
  'strapi::errors',
  {
    name: 'strapi::security',
    config: {
      contentSecurityPolicy: {
        useDefaults: true,
        directives: {
          'frame-src': ["'self'", 'cdn.jsdelivr.net', 'localhost:3000'],
        },
      }
    },
  },
  'strapi::cors',
  'strapi::poweredBy',
  'strapi::query',
  'strapi::body',
  'strapi::session',
  'strapi::favicon',
  'strapi::public',
];
```

## NextJS Starter Template

If you haven't already done so, bootstrap a NextJS project in a separate folder by running `npx create-next-app@latest web -e https://github.com/wecre8websites/strapi-page-builder-demo`

This gives you a ready-to-go site, multilanguage site with (@wecre8websites/strapi-page-builder-react)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wecre8websites/strapi-page-builder-react] installed and several Page Builder components to get you started.

You'll need to create and API Token in the Strapi Admin panel and save it to the `.env` of the Page Builder demo app, along with your Page Builder API Key. Get one free at (https://pagebuilder.wc8.io)[https://pagebuilder.wc8.io]
